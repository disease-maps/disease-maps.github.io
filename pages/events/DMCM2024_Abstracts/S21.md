**Abstract:** \
Disease maps are built via manual curation of biomedical literature; in this process, biocurators identify molecular processes (MPs) associated with the disease of interest in scientific articles and encode these MPs into diagrams according to systems biology graphical standards. While there exist general guidelines on building disease maps, well documented procedures for the identification of MPs for building disease maps are still missing. We offer here tips on how to identify disease-relevant MPs from papers. Our tips include how to (1) recognize the structure of phrases or sentences describing MPs in a paper, (2) locate where MPs are mentioned, (3) check which MPs are experimentally detected in the paper, (4) find experimental evidence confirming the existence of MPs (e.g., biochemical assays), as well as (5) confirming their association with the disease (e.g., assays in relevant cell types), (6) ascertain the organs, tissues or cell types where the MPs are detected and (7) extract relevant MPs from large-scale omics data. These tips can help biocurators working on disease maps or developing other systems biology resources.
