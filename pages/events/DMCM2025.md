## Sister Meetings

**HARMONY 2025**

Simultaneously from 15th to 17th April 2025 at the same venue.

The "**Computational Modeling in Biology**" Network (**COMBINE**) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats in systems biology, synthetic biology and related fields. HARMONY is a codefest-type meeting, with a focus on development of the standards, interoperability and infrastructure. There are generally not many general discussions or oral presentations during HARMONY; instead, the time is devoted to allowing hands-on hacking and interaction between people focused on practical development of software and standards.

The HARMONY 2025 will be held simultaneously with DMCM2025, in the same venue. This is expected to enhance interaction between the Disease Maps and COMBINE communities, fostering collaboration opportunities and networking. Coffee breaks and meals will be shared between both meetings.

More information can be found here: [HARMONY2025](https://co.mbine.org/events/). 

To have access to the HARMONY talks, registrations should be done separately. 

**byteMAL'25**

Monday 14th April 2025

ByteMAL is a conference created by and for early-career researchers in the fields of bioinformatics and systems biomedicine and aims to provide a networking platform for knowledge and expertise exchange across borders. Aiming to vitalize communication amongst researchers from The Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, ByteMAL has been hosted alternately by the
Universities of Maastricht, Aachen, and Liege and for the first time it comes to Leuven! More information will be announced soon.
