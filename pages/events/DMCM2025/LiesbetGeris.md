### Intracellular signaling: from toxicology over osteoarthritis to the virtual human twin

Multi-scale models of human (patho)physiology are important building blocks of the integrated  Virtual Human Twin. In this talk I will first discuss how we apply models of intracellular signaling, using disease maps and other concepts, as the internal loop of a multiscale model of skeletal tissue degeneration and as a way to build insight into toxicological processes in a range of organ systems. At the end, I will discuss how these models and approaches fit in the context of the integrated Virtual Human Twin and highlight the importance of the ecosystem in realizing its potential.
