### Disease maps and irAOPs in the immune system effects of immunomodulatory therapies

Kristin Reiche, Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology IZI, Department of Diagnostics, Germany

The EU funded project [imSAVAR](https://imsavar.eu/) (Immune safety avatar: Nonclinical mimicking of the immune system effects of immunomodulatory therapies) develops a platform to improve the prediction of potential side effects and thereby the safety and efficacy of immunomodulatory therapeutics. imSAVAR utilizes irAOPs (immune-related adverse outcome pathways) to describe the sequential order of key events, test systems as well as related molecules that result in an immune-related adverse outcome. In the symposium we give an overview of imSAVAR’s guidelines and methods to use Disease Maps as a computational knowledge repository of irAOPs, and provide insights in identified challenges and possible solutions of thereof. We will discuss possible systems biomedicine approaches to advance the computataional use of irAOPs.
