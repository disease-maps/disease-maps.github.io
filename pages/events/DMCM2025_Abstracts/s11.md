**Title:** \
A roadmap for the MINERVA Platform - recent changes and future plans

**Authors:** \
Marek Ostaszewski, Piotr Gawron, Venkata Satagopam, and Reinhard Scnheider

**Abstract:** \
The MINERVA Platform is a software supporting visualisation of systems biology diagrams, focused on exploration of systems biology diagrams, visual data analytics, and interoperability of systems biology formats. MINERVA evolves for over a decade, and its roadmap is aligned with the suggestions of the Disease Maps Community. 

We will present recent changes in MINERVA, including vector graphics-based diagram display, enhancing basic functionalities with seamless plugins, and a graphical user interface to introduce glyphs into the diagrams. We will discuss next steps for MINERVA, outline an updated roadmap and invite the Community to provide their feedback and ideas.
