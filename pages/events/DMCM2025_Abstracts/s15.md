**Abstract:** \
We will present the initial findings from our survey across the Disease Maps Community. Our investigation captured data on development stages, funding structures, technical platforms, training needs and practical applications from multiple ongoing initiatives. Preliminary results reveal emerging patterns in methodological approaches, common implementation challenges, and successful collaboration strategies spanning diverse biological domains. These insights provide a foundation for strengthening the community, establishing best practices and identifying synergistic opportunities within the disease map projects.
