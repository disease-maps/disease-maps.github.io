**Title:** \
libsbgnpy: A Python Library for Handling Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) in Disease Maps

**Authors:** \
Matthias KÃ¶nig

**Abstract:** \
Graphical representations play a crucial role in systems biology and systems medicine, facilitating the visualization and interpretation of complex biological networks. The libsbgnpy library provides a comprehensive Python-based solution for working with the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN), a standardized framework for visually representing biological processes. Built upon the SBGN XML schema, libsbgnpy enables seamless reading, writing, and validation of SBGN files, ensuring interoperability across computational biology platforms.

One key application of libsbgnpy is its integration with platforms like MINERVA, where it enhances the management and visualization of disease maps. By providing a robust and extensible toolkit for handling SBGN, libsbgnpy facilitates the development of standardized, machine-readable models, promoting reproducibility and accessibility in systems medicine and computational biology.

This talk will present the latest release of libsbgnpy, showcasing newly added features and improvements that enhance its usability and performance. Attendees will gain insights into how these updates contribute to more efficient handling of disease maps, along with potential future developments to further advance the ecosystem of SBGN-based modeling and visualization.

libsbgnpy is available from https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/libsbgn-python and described in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.597155.
