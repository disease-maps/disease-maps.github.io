### Description

The development of the human immune system is biologically complex, as different niches and cell types are involved in the various stages of development. To date, knowledge about the development of the immune system relies primarily on animal data, and the availability of in vitro and in silico new approach methodologies (NAMs) to assess effects on the developing immune system without the use of animals is highly desirable. In order to capture the biological complexity of the developing immune system and guide the development of in vitro and in silico NAMs, we started building a map on the human immune system development. A physiological map is a tool derived from the Disease Maps project that focuses on the underlying undisturbed physiological processes. Based on extensive literature curation, the human immune system development map (HIDmap) graphically represents the specific cell type niches and complex biological interactions involved during prenatal development, including cell migration, cell-cell interactions, and signaling molecules. The major niches involved in the immune system development are the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region, yolk sac, fetal liver, bone marrow, spleen, and thymus. Cell types that play a role in the development of the immune system include, but are not limited to, hematopoietic stem cells, progenitor cells, T-cells, B-cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and monocytes. The main goal of the HIDmap is to map as comprehensively as possible, the developing human immune system to identify existing knowledge gaps and provide a valuable resource for both research and regulatory purposes in pharmacology and toxicology. In this context, the HIDmap is envisaged to provide a basis for the development of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs), computational models, and human-based in vitro NAMs for toxicological testing, therefore presenting the biological basis for a NAM-based test battery for developmental immunotoxicity (DIT).
